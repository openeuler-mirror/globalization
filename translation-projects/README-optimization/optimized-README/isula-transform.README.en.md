# isula-transform

## Description

`isula-transform` is a tool that converts the configuration of the docker container to a type that isulad can recognize as being loaded.

## Build and Installation

Before building, ensure that [Golang](https://golang.org/) 1.13 or later and [lcr](https://gitee.com/openeuler/lcr) 2.0.1 or later are installed successfully.

Just execute `sudo make && sudo make install` in the code root directory and enjoy it.

### NOTE

There are a few things to note about using `isula-transform` :

- currently, only docker 18.09 containers can be transformed to isulad container
- due to isulad's lack of native network capability, docker container needs to configure host network
- `isula-transform` will read the container's OCI configuration, which requires the docker container to be in a pause or running state, and  pause it if it is in a running state

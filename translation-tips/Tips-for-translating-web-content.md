# Tips for translating web content

## General rules

* **Concise**

  "Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts."

  ----**William Strunk Jr.,** *The Elements of Style*

  Concise writing is always recommended. Follow the keep it short and simple (KISS) principle to make sure your translation (or writing) is alway clear and concise.

* **Accurate**

  Produce translations that are accurate and faithful to the originals. To achieve this objective, you need to be familiar with the basic concepts and specific terminology of the project that you are translating.

* **Useful and sense-making**

  Avoid word-for-word translations. Translate the meaning, not just the words. 

  Cultural equivalents are recommended to make sure your translation is useful and fits the context of the target language. For example, avoid using words and graphics that have special connotations for a particular culture.

* **Bias-free communication**

  As our technologies aim to reach people across the globe, it is critical to have inclusive and diverse communications.

  Some general principles for reducing bias:

  * Use gender-neutral alternatives for common terms, for example, chair instead of chairman, sales representative instead of salesman, etc. 
  * Use second person (you) instead of he, him, his, she, her, or hers.
  * Use text and images that represent diverse perspectives and circumstances.
  * Be mindful when you need to name cities, countries, or regions. Make sure they are not politically disputed. 
  * Avoid using slangs. 
  * Avoid using religious and political terms.  

* **Consistency in visuals and formatting**

  Keep the formatting neat, and use consistent project colors, logos, images, and fonts.  A nice formatting is always a plus.

## Language-specific rules

* **Spelling**

  American English spelling is recommended. Avoid non-English words in English translations. 

* **Capitalization**

  Sentence-style capitalization is recommended. Use lowercase words except the first word and proper nouns, such as brands, products, and services.

* **Voice and tone**

  Active voice and simple language are preferred. 

  Active voice is usually clear, concise, and direct in any type of documents, which help smooth expression and understanding. 

  As an open source community, we prefer natural communication. Remember, simpler is always better.

* **Tense**

  Incorrect use of tenses may mislead readers. Select the most appropriate verb tense based on  the context.

* **Acronyms and abbreviations**

  An abbreviation is a shortened or contracted form of a word or a phrase. An acronym is a type of abbreviation derived from initial letters or from parts of a compound term that forms a pronounceable word, such as LAN, RADAR, and SCUBA. 

  Use the full spelling when an abbreviation or acronym appear for the first time.

  Provide a list of acronyms and abbreviations if they are frequently used in a document.

* **Citations**

  Provide a source if there is any citation. If it is a direct quote, use quotation marks, and indent in a new line. Use italics for titles of books and periodicals. 

* **Punctuation**

  Use grammatically and meaningfully correct punctuations because they are important for reader understanding. There are well-documented rules for using English punctuations appropriately. Whenever you have doubts, look up before you use.
